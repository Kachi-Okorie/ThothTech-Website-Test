      OnTrack is an online assessment tool that provides students with a task-oriented approach to portfolio assessment.
      Students work through a series of tasks in order to complete their unit learning outcomes.<br />
      <br />
       It is one of the bigger projects ran by Thoth Tech. It is a live production system that is in use at Deakin
      University. Continuously evolving and expanding, it has been refined to serve as an outstanding educational tool
      for both students and staff at the university. Its technological foundation comprises a Ruby on Rails backend and
      an Angular JS / Angular 15 frontend. Several projects aimed at augmenting and advancing this product are available
      for students to engage with and contribute to its enhancements.<br /><br />
       OnTrack is sold under a package called Formatif and is available for purchase by the general public.
