      At Deakin University, a large repertoire of courses are available for potential students to enrol in to help shape
      their future career goals. Each of these courses will have a set of requirements ranging from minimum credit
      points achieved, completion of core units and completion of minor/major sequences with required units etc.<br />
      <br />
       These course and unit requirements can prove to be a challenge to keep track off and manage for some students. As
      such, there is a need for a tool that can help students plan their course and help them manage their course and
      unit requirements.<br /><br />
       Courseflow is a product which is in its development stage. It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for
      students to plan their degree and be capable of considering course and unit requirements.

Secondly, electives will feature a distinct interface, akin to the course, requiring a query system to filter units based on user-defined criteria. In both these components, units will be equipped with a clear indicator denoting their validity for selection based on the existing course map settings.',

This includes showcasing unit prerequisites and other specific requirements, demonstrating the current progress towards fulfilling these criteria (such as completing a specific number of units, like 2 SIT coded units). To facilitate this display accurately, the course and unit data must be intricately linked with the defined requirements. This data will then be cross-referenced with the current course map settings to ensure that the visuals accurately reflect the progress and fulfillment status of these requirements.',
