      Indigenous and rural artists often face barriers in accessing the broader market, limiting their opportunities for
      income and recognition. Our platform seeks to eliminate these barriers by leveraging modern technology to empower
      artists to reach a wider consumer base, while bringing diverse cultures together.<br />
      <br />
       We aim to deliver a highly available and scalable ecommerce platform that will allow for ease of sale of artwork
      by small local artists. We plan to do this with our easily maintained C# minimal RESTful API, Vue frontend, and
      our suite of other technologies used in streamlining the development pf our product.<br />
