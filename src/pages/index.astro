      Thoth Tech is a software development company currently building from the ground up in Melbourne, Australia. Thoth
      Techâ€™s mission is to build, operate, and deploy education technologies, creating tools that enhance education
      outcomes by empowering students, connecting them with tutors, and facilitating personalised learning experiences.
      <br />
       We value our people, and we value excellence. We are people-focused, aiming to produce sustainable products of
      excellent quality, and provide frameworks that supply a safe environment for learning and support of our team.
      <br />
       Deakin University implemented a Capstone program aimed at preparing students for real-world scenarios. This
      initiative involves partnering with companies such as Thoth Tech, enabling students to gain industry exposure
      across two trimesters. Upon concluding the Capstone program within this timeframe, students transition to other
      units and move forward from their engagement with the company.
      <br />
       Some of the work done by students can be found in our Documentation Website.
