      Thoth Tech's Company Operations department serves as the hub that manages the entirety of the company's functions.
      Our primary objective is to provide the necessary policies, procedures, and resources that empower each student to
      concentrate on their daily tasks, thereby propelling them toward their individual goals and objectives.<br />
      <br />
       Given our company's frequent turnover every three months, our team is dedicated to ensuring seamless business
      continuity. We achieve this by establishing transparent guidelines and structures that enable incoming teams to
      seamlessly pick up where the previous student cohort left off.<br /><br />
